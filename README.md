# Apollo Soundboard
A free, open source soundboard written in .NET for Windows

# How to Use
Download the latest release and run *Apollo Soundboard.exe*

You may need a [Virtual Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) if you want to route the audio through your microphone.

The Mic Injector injects your microphone output to the virual audio cable selected. If you would like to be heard alongside your sounds, enable this. A hotkey can be assigned to toggle the Mic Injector.

To bind a hotkey to stopping all sounds, click the hotkey selector under the "Stop All" button

To add sounds, click the "Add" button or drag a supported sound file into the window. 

# Supported Files

Apollo Soundboard supports *.wav*, *.ogg* and *.mp3* files. An audio converter is included in the *Options* menu to convert any media to one of these formats. FFMPEG is required, and will require about 200 megabytes of space in the soundboard directory.

# Special Thanks

Thank you to expenosa for creating [EXP Soundboard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/expsoundboard/). Apollo soundboard is heavily inspired through function and design by EXP and would not have been possible without it.
